"""Tests for shared conversation access.

Users can share conversation links (containing UUIDs) with others.
When accessing a shared conversation:
- The conversation is viewable (read-only)
- The owner's email is shown in the header
- The chat input is disabled/hidden
- Users cannot send new messages to shared conversations
