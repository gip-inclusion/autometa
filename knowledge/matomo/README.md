## Common Parameters

All analytics methods accept:
- `idSite` - Site ID (117 for Emplois)
- `period` - day, week, month, year, or range
- `date` - YYYY-MM-DD, today, yesterday, lastN
- `segment` - Filter expression (e.g., `pageUrl=@/gps/`)

Optional modifiers:
- `flat=1` - Flatten hierarchical results
- `expanded=1` - Include subtables inline
- `filter_limit=N` - Max rows to return

## Critical Behaviors

### ⚠️ Segments Are Expensive — Treat Every Segmented Query as Slow

**Matomo segments trigger a full scan of raw visit data.** On large sites
(Emplois has millions of visits), a single segmented query for one month
takes **30–180 seconds**. This is not a bug — it's how Matomo works.

**Pre-computed vs. ad-hoc segments:**

| Type | Speed | How to tell |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Pre-computed** (archived) | Fast (< 5s) | Listed in `SegmentEditor.getAll` with `auto_archive=1` |
| **Saved but not archived** | Slow (30-180s) | Listed in `SegmentEditor.getAll` with `auto_archive=0` |
| **Ad-hoc** (inline segment string) | Slow (30-180s) | Not saved at all — computed on the fly |

**The danger:** Writing a script that loops over 12+ months with an ad-hoc
segment creates 12+ sequential slow queries = **6-36 minutes** of wall time.
This WILL cause the Bash tool to timeout, background the script, and trap
the conversation in a polling loop.

**Rules:**
1. **Max 5 segmented queries per script.** No exceptions.
2. **Prefer date ranges without segments** — `date=2025-01-01,2025-12-31`
   without a segment returns all months instantly as a keyed dict.
3. **With segments, query 2-3 months max**, show results, offer to fetch more.
4. **Check if a segment is pre-computed** before bulk-querying with it:
   ```python
   result = execute_matomo_query(
       instance="inclusion", caller=CallerType.AGENT,
       method="SegmentEditor.getAll", params={"idSite": 117})
   for seg in result.data:
       print(f"{seg['name']}: auto_archive={seg.get('auto_archive')}")
   ```
5. **Always print progress** after each query in multi-query scripts.

### Asynchronous Report Processing

**Matomo generates reports asynchronously.** Synchronous processing doesn't work well
due to database size.

**What this means:**
- **New segments/filters** (e.g., users who visited `/dashboard/` for the first time)
  → Results take **12-24 hours** to become available
- **Existing segments combined** (e.g., combining two already-processed filters)
  → Results are **immediate**, no reprocessing needed

**Practical implications:**
1. If you need data on a new URL pattern or custom segment, plan ahead
2. Test queries with existing segments first to validate your approach
3. Don't assume a timeout means the query is wrong — it might just need processing time

### Geo data
Matomo's geo data is very unprecise, as it often relies on IP address. A lot of our users being professionnals, they often use shared IP range that will not give an accurate representation of their location.
As much as possible, when in need with geo data, use Metabase (Dora, Stats or Datalake). You may not get data for all products/services, and only for logged-in users, but the geo data is accurate, and may serve as a proxy. The table pdi_base_unique_tous_les_pros in datalake has accurate logged-in geo data by department (departement_structure). Although it only gives last connexion info per service, it is a good representation of products usage (again, for logged-in users)


## Python Client Quick Reference

```python
from skills.matomo_query.scripts.matomo import MatomoAPI
api = MatomoAPI()  # loads credentials from .env

# Core methods
api.get_visits(site_id, period, date, segment=None)           # VisitsSummary.get
api.get_dimension(site_id, dimension_id, period, date, segment=None)  # CustomDimensions
api.get_pages(site_id, period, date, pattern=None, segment=None)      # Actions.getPageUrls
api.get_event_categories(site_id, period, date, segment=None)         # Events.getCategory
api.get_event_actions(site_id, period, date, segment=None)            # Events.getAction
