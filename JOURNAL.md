- 2026-01-03. Reorganized knowledge/: sites/ for website docs, matomo/ for API reference. Split API reference into README.md (index), core-modules.md, cohorts.md, funnels.md. Updated AGENTS.md with new structure.
- 2026-01-03. AGENTS.md: reports must be written in French by default.
- 2026-01-03. Updated Cohorts methods with correct API: get_cohorts() uses Cohorts.getCohorts, added get_cohorts_over_time() and get_cohorts_by_first_visit().
- 2026-01-03. Added get_visit_frequency() and get_cohorts() to matomo.py. Updated UI_MAPPING.
- 2026-01-03. Refactored querying skill: extracted UI mapping to ui_mapping.py. Added test suite (test_matomo.py) with 18 unit tests + 14 integration tests. Added conftest.py for configurable test parameters.

- 2026-01-03. Updated AGENTS.md: clarified data sourcing rules — every data point needs a clickable Matomo UI link + raw API call.
- 2026-01-03. Added `get_ui_url()` and `format_data_source()` to scripts/matomo.py: generates clickable Matomo web UI links from API method calls. Maps API methods to UI categories.
